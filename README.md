A full-stack developer in training with an ever curious mind and a passion for problem solving.

After completing a BSc in Biomedical Sciences, I moved into the world of construction, where following a 6 month internship, I became the Skills and Employment manager for a large London Transport project. This challenging and varied role allowed me to learn and develop ... and the level of responsiblity I undertook gave me the opportunity to adapt to new situations outside of my comfort zone at every turn.

I gained so much from this role, but due to a lack of development opportunities and a yearning to get back to my scientific roots, I was drawn to the world of software development, and subsequently Makers Academy. 

I am passionate about learning in any capacity, and in particular anything related to tech. I also enjoy disseminating what I have learned with others through discussion with passionate developers, project work and presenting.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my previous role in construction I built relationships with various stakeholders, and often acted as the sole representitive of the project and business. This required me to communicate and build trust with, and present to different parties in an accessible and adaptable manner. I interacted daily with school children, supply chain, local residents and governing bodies, tailoring my style of communication to each group.

##### Other ways I have honed this skill:
- While at university I was Social Secretary of the Swimming Club and was responsible for all social events and social media throughout the first year the society existed.
- During my degree I had to give multiple presentations based on research projects such as Parkinson's Disease as well as my dissertation project on the role of brain steroids in Alzheimer's Disease.
- During my university summer holiday I managed a café where I was in charge of coordinating and training a team, and following university I worked in a coffee shop in London where at peak times communication between other members of the team as well as customers was vital.
- Having spent 3 months in Ecuador speaking Spanish I now have a greater understanding of how much communication depends not only on words but guestures and body language, which developed my empathy for the difficulties faced by non-english speakers.

#### Responsibility

In my previous role I was responsible for the skills and employment side of a 550 person and £500 million project. As such I worked as a one person team to fulfill all of the requirements around social sustainability indlucing meeting rigorous and varied targets around apprenticeships, local job starts, upskilling and community projects. 

##### Other ways I have honed this skill:
- During my time on the project I achieved the lifetime project targets set around skills and employment within 3 years (on a 5 year project).
- Whilst at university I was Treasurer of the Swimming Club during my final year, and I responsibly managed this role at a time when the membership of the club had tripled from the previous year and whilst I was undertaking my final year studies and exams and childminding in during the evening.

#### Drive and initiative

During my role in construction my passion for social sustainability grew exponentially. I pioneered a project to help refugee engineers into employment on the project and collaborated with Wandsworth Prison in order to secure future roles for ex-offenders on the project. Additionally I'm very driven to help young people access the best opportunities possible, and through working with charities was able to provde the buiness case to employ several young people from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds.
Additionally I became a STEM Ambassador and Counstruction Youth Trust Ambassador and visited schools to give presentations and run workshops aimed around promoting the construction industry to young people, and I continue to be very passionate about empowering young women into STEM and Tech roles.


##### Leadership
During the first month of my internship I was given the responsibility of deigning and delivering the project's stand at Big Bang Fair at the Birmingham NEC as well as 2 regional events in London. As such I designed an activity for the stand and led a team of volunteers at each event, engaing with over 400 students in the process.

##### Other ways I have honed this skill:
- Whilst at Makers Academy I implemented a feedback system used by my cohort each day to facilitate collaboratiion.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (July - October 2017)

- I am curious and passionate about code. I love to break concepts down into their component parts and analyse exactly how they relate to one another. 
  I am currently implementing a week of lightning talks at lunch during which each member of the cohort will speak about a facet of tech that intruiges them, in order to not only alert the rest of the Makers students in all cohorts to exciting things they might not know about, but also to improve our public speaking and presenting skills.
- I'm a fast and independent learner. During 8 weeks at Makers I have used Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Rails, Node JS, Sinatra, Capybara, Express, Zombie, Jasmine, RSpec, Mocha, Chai, PostgreSQL, Sequelize and Data Mapper with no previous experience in the field. In addition I now feel comfortable learning new and complex concepts and skills with Makers having taught us how to learn in the most efficient ways.
